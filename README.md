# Mango-Lassi-Survey-Visualization
## Description
The project was a physical survey of Mango Lassi at an Asian Food Festival in Vienna, where 200 people participated in the survey. We wanted to explore and understand the drink's popularity, so I went on to visualize the result in Python to understand it further visually.
## Objective
We went with the following objectives in mind
- To understand whether the drink is popular or not.
- To see how people from different countries like the drink.
- To check whether people like Mango Lassi.
- To see whether people will like to have Mango Lassi with different Cuisines.
- To get information about the price people would like to pay at supermarkets for the Mango Lassi Drink.
- To understand whether people like Vegan base or Dairy Base yoghurt.
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The initial dataset had some issues, so Data Cleaning involved:
- Using the Ethnicity Data and creating a Country list according to it.
- When we were asking questions about supermarket prices for Mango Lassi, people gave a lower rate and a higher rate, so we had to average that out for the Boxplot.
- The question, of whether people want to have Mango lassi at different cuisine places had 2 answers, one was yes and then they had to list the cuisines, so I had to separate the yes and the cuisine from the dataset. 
## Analysis and Insights
1. Above 60 Nationalities participated in the Survey.
2. Majority of the Survey participants were between the ages of 18 and 45.
3. Approx. 80% of the Survey participants already knew about Mango Lassi.
4. 76.5% of the survey participants rated the drink above 7, And out of the 200 not a single person rated it below 5.
5. Out of the 200 survey participants 66 people like both dairy and vegan bases for yoghurt, 101 prefer only dairy, and 20 only vegan.
6. Median Price which the survey participants were ready to pay at supermarkets was 3 euros for a bottle of 250-300ml but here I disagree as they use the restaurant prices of mango lassi as a reference but at supermarkets, things are way cheaper, like in Edeka popular supermarket in Germany priced its Mango Lassi product at 1 euro.
7. People in Switzerland Pay higher prices for the products which is why the outlier in female data were ready to pay even 6-7 euros for Mango Lassi.
## Conclusion
Overall, the survey underscores the strong appeal of Mango Lassi across different demographics and nationalities. The insights gained from this project can inform marketing strategies, pricing decisions, and product development to better cater to consumer preferences and expand the market for Mango Lassi.

By leveraging data visualization techniques, we were able to uncover these insights effectively and provide a clear picture of the current landscape for Mango Lassi in Vienna. This project not only enhanced our understanding of consumer preferences but also showcased the power of data-driven decision-making in the food and beverage industry.
